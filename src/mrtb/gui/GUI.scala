/**
 * The GUI class. Initially I attempted to set it up using Scage, but due to an
 * illegal inheritance related to self-types and scage's very poor documentation, I had to give up
 * on that after battling with it for almost a whole day. My next attempt was at using Slick and
 * lwjgl 3.0, but I was unable to run anything using them - I had lots of trouble setting the build path
 * as well. It might be a Java/Scala issue, or perhaps I was using incompatible versions. In the end, I decided
 * to cut my losses short and get on with Scala Swing, abandoning most of the visual stylishness I had
 * planned to create. Perhaps it was naïve from me to expect being able to set up a gfx library within
 * one or two hours.
 * 
 * As for the implementation here, the game's GUI essentially consists of two screens - the main menu
 * and the actual gameplay. The two panel that represent them is created right away, and then
 * various elements are painted on the panel. Due to time restrictions, there might be some discrepancy
 * between Scala and Java style implementations regarding Swing and the event handling.
 * 
 * If there was more time, I'd create an abstract class that would make implementing other UIs easier.
 * Right now, extensibility by modifying or adding code is not one of my top priorities, although
 * I certainly intend to keep the system flexible to changes and resilient to errors.
