# A macro defining a "default" wave consisting of two goblin spawns.
# Usage: writing {defaultwave} in a stage file essentially replaces the text
# with the text defined here inbetween !!start and !!end.
!macro
id=defaultwave
!!start
!wave
greengoblin, 8, 30, 0
greengoblin, 6, 60, 30 * 8 + 60
!!end


# Additional usefulness is always a good thing, though. The system also manages
# variables; there are used by calling, for example, {defaultwave_with_variables 30 10}.
# See the documentation or consult the developer for more information and details.
!macro
id=defaultwave_with_variables
vars=2
!!start
!wave
greengoblin, 8, $0, 0
